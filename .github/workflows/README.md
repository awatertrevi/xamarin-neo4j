2. Select "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch (usually `main`)
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Monitoring

- **Status Badges**: The main README includes a status badge showing deployment status
- **Action Logs**: Click on any workflow run in the Actions tab to see detailed logs
- **Deployment URL**: After successful deployment, the site is available at `https://kl0070.github.io/xamarin-neo4j/`

## Troubleshooting

**Deployment fails with permission error**:
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Check that Actions have the required permissions

**Validation fails**:
- Check the validation logs for specific HTML errors
